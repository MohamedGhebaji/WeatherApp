        //set the title view icon, there is many way to do it :
        // 1. Create a base class and it in the base class and then all the others classes should inherit from the base class to have the functiionaly (not very good in swift ==> Not very swifty)
        // 2. Use a protocol that define the functioanty in the protocol extension and the any vc whant to have the icon, conforme to the protocl : swifty and good
        // 3. Use of the viewController swizzling, not bad also, less code
        navigationItem.titleView = UIImageView(image: UIImage(named: "ic_nav_bar_paris"))
